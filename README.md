Introduction
============

I want to practice C basics by writing imaginary device drivers. I really like managing memory: writing to it, reading from it, and then playing with values.
I chose a "device" driver because I see the beauty of this program even in its name. I love designing my own abstractions and doing it like a "professional".
Now it's just a static library. If you want to read the code, I'd like to hear any feedback (even trolling). I decided to upload it to GitHub because I love 
feeling that my project is more than just a source directory. I am pleased to see the path of my work and its textual record. This project is, furthermore, 
a part of me and my attitude toward code.

Goals
=====

Over time, I want to move on to real driver development. I'm interested in GPUs and embedded systems. In GPUs, I love the speed of their work and the results. 
In embedded systems, I love their variety and variability. I love not only the device itself, but also the way it symbiotically interacts with the operating 
system: strict adherence to all parameters and invariants, meticulous memory management. Refactoring such code produces results of incredible beauty. I love 
seeing code that is logical, consistent, secure, and written by someone with an inherent responsibility toward the user. That's not all the reasons -- there 
are quite a few more than I’ve mentioned.
