I want to practice C basics by writing imaginary device drivers. I really like to manage memory: write to it, read from it and then play with values. 
I chose "device" driver because I see the beauty of this program even in its name. I love to design my own abstractions and do it like a "professional".

I decided to upload it on Github because I love feeling that my project is more than just a source directory. I am pleased to see the path of my work 
and its textual recording.

Now it's just a static library. I'll write minimal examples to show how to work with it. If you want to read the code, I'd like to hear any 
feedback (even trolling). This project is further a part of me and my attitude towards code.
